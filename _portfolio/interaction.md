To let robots learn HRI(Human Robot Interaction), I believe it is necessary to make robot understand interactions first. In our [previous research](..), robot start to learn to interact with people totally based on camera informations, which limited the capability of the robot to learn more complex interactions.

Also, it's obvious that skeleton key points contains far more dense informations of human actions than raw images. So ,with many state of art researches that make it easy to obtain skeleton informations, I think we can build a skeleton based interaction classifier to help robot understand what are people doing and respond according to the result.
