## 生成对抗网络，逆向强化学习和能量模型的一个结合

### 摘要



### Problem set

### Method

### Result

*. Precise equivalence between GANs and sample-based algorithm for training EBMs and MaxEnt inverse RL
*. Suggests a one-line change to GAN training
*. Correspondence with inverse RL demonstrates GAN training improves sample quality over direct max likelihood
